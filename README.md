# üßä Arctic Sea Ice Forecast üìà

![Sea Ice Age](images/SeaIce_Age.jpg)

## üåé Background

The Arctic is warming at a rate nearly twice the global average, causing dramatic changes in sea ice coverage and thickness. Declining Arctic sea ice is one of the most visible indicators of climate change, with profound impacts on global weather patterns, polar ecosystems, and indigenous communities.

This project aims to analyze and forecast Arctic sea ice extent using time series modeling and data science tools. Accurate forecasting is essential for understanding climate trends, supporting environmental policy, and informing future research.

## üìÅ Repository Structure

- `Assign2.R`, `GroupShared.R`: R scripts for analysis and forecasting.
- `Assignment3_TS.Rmd`, `iceForecast.Rmd`: RMarkdown documents for reporting and reproducible research.
- `data/`: Contains raw and processed datasets.
- `images/`: Contains visualization figures and results.
- `final report/`: Project report and results.

## üñºÔ∏è Example Visualizations

Below are some example outputs from the forecasting analysis:

![Original Sea Ice Data](images/Fig1_orig_data.jpeg)
*Original time series of Arctic sea ice extent.*

## üöÄ How to Run

1. **Clone this repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/capgalea/artic_sea_ice_forecast.git
   cd artic_sea_ice_forecast
   ```

2. **Open the Project in RStudio:**
   - Open `artic_sea_ice_forecast.Rproj`.

3. **Install Dependencies:**
   - Open any of the R scripts (`Assign2.R`, `GroupShared.R`, or `iceForecast.Rmd`) and install required packages if prompted, e.g.:
     ```r
     install.packages(c("tidyverse", "forecast", "lubridate", "readr", "ggplot2"))
     ```

4. **Run Analysis:**
   - To run the full analysis, knit the RMarkdown files (`iceForecast.Rmd`, `Assignment3_TS.Rmd`) in RStudio or run the scripts directly.

5. **View Outputs:**
   - Visualizations and results will be saved in the `images/` folder or displayed in the RMarkdown HTML output.

## üìù Notes

- Data files are located in the `data/` directory. Please ensure you have all data files required for the scripts.
- Modify paths if running outside the project root.
